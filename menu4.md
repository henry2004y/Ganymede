# Gallieo Spacecraft

Kivelson [1997,1998] has actually discussed about the idea of reconnection efficiency. It's so amazing for me. In the meantime, they had ideas of K-H instability happening at G8 magnetopause crossing based on magnetic perturbation phase analysis. Again, it is amazing.

We have some more discussions in [Zhou+, 2020].
