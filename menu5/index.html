This may explain the production of discrete frequency ULF waves in the magnetosphere and statistical correlations between Pc5 power on the ground and solar wind velocity</p> <p>Opinion: Alfvénic waves propagating along the magnetopause surface may develop into standing Alfvén waves on the boundary due to reflection from the conjugate ionospheres &#40;i.e. Kruskal-Schwarzschild modes&#41;. The surface waves are likely due to magnetopause displacements as a result of local pressure perturbations in the magnetosheath, while the eigenfrequencies of the standing modes are determined by the magnetopause geometry and are strikingly similar to the Samson ‘magic’ frequencies. This combination of conditions suggests that the oscillations are more likely due to Kruskal-Schwarzshild modes than solar wind pressure perturbations or the KHI at the flanks.</p> <p>Within the magnetosphere, there are two possible mechanics:</p> <ul> <li><p>drift-mirror instabilities &#40;?&#41; due to high <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.05278em;">β</span></span></span></span> pressure anisotropies</p> <li><p>drift-bounce resonance &#40;?&#41; with trapped energetic ions</p> </ul> <p>strongly compressional, high azimuthal wave number m, attenuated on the ground.</p> <h2 id=physics ><a href="#physics" class=header-anchor >Physics</a></h2> <p>Margy has done a lot in this field.</p> <h3 id=wave_generation_and_propagation_mechanisms ><a href="#wave_generation_and_propagation_mechanisms" class=header-anchor >Wave Generation and Propagation Mechanisms</a></h3> <p>The propagation of magnetospheric ULF plasma waves has been described usually usually in the context of standing shear Alfvén mode field line oscillations with low azimuthal wavenumber that are driven by energy coupling from incoming compressional fast mode waves.</p> <p>global eigenoscillations of the magnetosphere or the plasmasphere</p> <p>In fact, the coupling of cavity or waveguide eigenmodes to FLRs may explain how discrete spectra are produced across a range of latitudes, including at the &quot;magic&quot; frequencies.</p> <p>The global cavity modes <em>may be</em> responsible for the appearance of ULF signals with multiple discrete spectral peaks at the &quot;magic&quot; frequencies and spanning a range of latitudes, but it lacks observation support and is hard to detect with satellites. &#40;This is interesting&#33;&#41;</p> <p>termed the plasmaspheric global mode a virtual resonance &#40;?&#41;</p> <p>The mathematical description of field line resonance &#40;FLR&#41; often assume a simple dipole magnetic field which is not appropriate to high latitudes where field lines experience significant temporal distortion. This affects the <em>frequency</em> and <em>polarization</em> properties of the FLRs. The latter is important because wave-particle energy transfer involves the wave electric field component parallel to the drift velocity of particle, i.e. the azimuthal field &#40;poloidal mode&#41; in a dipolar magnetic field.</p> <p>The Poynting flux is field aligned and away from the equatorial plane.

The characteristic fine structure appearance of ‘pearl’ Pc1 waves was attributed to dispersive field-aligned wave packet propagation in the LH ion mode on successive bounces between hemispheres. However, this still lacks observation support. Spacecraft measurements have shown that EMICW propagation is almost exclusively away from the equator at latitudes greater than about 11◦, with minimal reflection at the ionosphere.</p> <p>automated ULF wave detection algorithms using FFT wavelet transform technique&#40;?&#41;</p> <h2 id=simulations ><a href="#simulations" class=header-anchor >Simulations</a></h2> <h3 id=lfm ><a href="#lfm" class=header-anchor >LFM</a></h3> <p>LFM model by <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2007JA012890">Claudepierre&#43;, 2008</a>: The phase velocities of the modes were different but the frequencies were the same and depended on the solar wind driving velocity.

However, there is no clear consensus on a dominant mechanism. These are important questions since EMIC waves may control the precipitation of energetic ions and relativistic electrons.</p> <p>Plasma density is one of the most important parameters controlling EMIC wave generation.
