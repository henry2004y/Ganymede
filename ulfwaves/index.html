And we have not yet considered complications due to inhomogeneity and nonlinearity&#33;</p> </blockquote> <p>Given a background plasma state, a wave mode is a normal mode or eigenstate of the system. The eigen-value is usually taken to be the &#40;complex&#41; wave frequency \(\omega\), with the real wave-vector \(\mathbf{k}\) prescribed. The associated eigenvector is the set of fluctuating fields &#40;\(\delta\mathbf{E},\delta\mathbf{B}\)&#41; and plasma parameters &#40;\(\delta \rho, \delta\mathbf{u}, \delta P\) in the case of MHD or \(\delta f_j(\mathb f{v})\) for kinetic waves where j stands for each species&#41;. Mode identification is the process of comparing the observed eigenvalue/eigenvector with the possible theoretical ones and finding the one which matches.</p> <p>The practical implementation of mode identification is strewn with pitfalls and complications, including:</p> <ul> <li><p>There is usually a mixture, possibly phase-coherent, of modes and/or frequencies, rather than an isolated mode.</p> <li><p>Frequencies are often Doppler shifted by an unknown, or poorly known, amount.</p> <li><p>Wave vectors are difficult to determine from the one-&#40;or few-&#41; point measurements available from spacecraft.</p> <li><p>The mode eigenstate can depend sensitively on the wave vector, plasma \(\beta\), and temperature anisotropy, as well as on the contributions of multi-species or non-Maxwellian kinetic features.</p> <li><p>The temporal resolution and accuracy of some measurements, notably those related to particle populations and plasma moments, are often insufficient or marginal. Some important species or sub-population may not be measured at all. The result is that either or both the background state or fluctuations are not accurately known.</p> <li><p>Wave amplitudes are often large &#40;of order unity&#41;, implying nonlinear processes may be present and distort the eigenstate from its linear form, or give rise to intrinsically nonlinear eigenstates.</p> <li><p>Similarly, inhomogeneities can distort the wave propagation or eigenstate in ways which have largely been unexplored.</p> <li><p>As we have seen, the theoretical wave properties depend on the framework in which the theory is performed. There is a trade-off between the simplicity/dubious applicability of MHD or fluid treatments and the complexity associated with the infinite degrees of freedom of kinetic theory.</p> </ul> <p>Our ultimate goal, is to build a tool for identifying wave modes automatically. Steven has already envisioned two types of models &#40;decision tree, N-dimensional distance sampling&#41; in 1996. 20 years later, people would find it more appealing to use machine learning.</p> <p>The propagation of magnetospheric ULF plasma waves has been described usually usually in the context of standing shear Alfvén mode field line oscillations with low azimuthal wavenumber that are driven by energy coupling from incoming compressional fast mode waves.</p> <p>global eigenoscillations of the magnetosphere or the plasmasphere</p> <p>termed the plasmaspheric global mode a virtual resonance &#40;?&#41;</p> <p>The mathematical description of field line resonance &#40;FLR&#41; often assume a simple dipole magnetic field which is not appropriate to high latitudes where field lines experience significant temporal distortion. This affects the <em>frequency</em> and <em>polarization</em> properties of the FLRs. The latter is important because wave-particle energy transfer involves the wave electric field component parallel to the drift velocity of particle, i.e. the azimuthal field &#40;poloidal mode&#41; in a dipolar magnetic field.</p> <p>The Poynting flux is field aligned and away from the equatorial plane. These waves likely arise from incoming compressional mode waves coupling to guided Alfvén waves on the last closed field lines, exciting FLRs at lower latitudes.</p> <p>Estimation on how much energy does a FLR deposit into the ionosphere, the energy dissipated into the ionosphere via Joule heating</p> <p>Simply speaking, the nice math derivations does not work for nonideal magnetic field setup. Observers are clueless in knowing what is really going on.</p> <p>The MHD wave equations that describe the coupling between the fast compressional mode and the shear Alfvén mode are complicated and have not been completely solved analytically, even in a simple dipole geometry.</p> <p>Downstream of the quasi-perpendicular portion of the bow shock, solar wind protons and heavier ions &#40;helium ions&#41; are preferentially heated in the perpendicular direction to the magnetic field.<sup id="fnref:heating"><a href="#fndef:heating" class=fnref >[2]</a></sup> This heating creates strong temperature anisotropies which lead to intense wave growth. Several kinds of instabilities can be triggered: mirror mode instability and L-mode electromagnetic ion-cyclotron instability &#40;EMIC&#41;. EMIC mode dominates when the plasma β is low while mirror mode dominates when the plasma β is high. Slow modes may also be present within a transition layer close to the subsolar magnetopause, although they are expected to suffer strong damping.</p> <p><table class=fndef  id="fndef:heating"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:heating">[2]</a> <td class=fndef-content >Yuxi provides me with a nice starting point to think about this. The 1st adiabatic invariant, i.e. magnetic moment \(\mu_m = \frac{1}{2}m v_\perp^2 / B\) is almost conserved if the gyromotion is not violated. Across the quasi-perpendicular shock, the strength of the magnetic field increases, so the perpendicular thermal velocities must increase to maintain the magnetic moment. Therefore the perpendicular direction is preferentially heated downstream of the shock. For example, if the B field is increased by a factor of 2, then the ion perpendicular thermal velocity should increase by a factor of \(\sqrt{2}\), and the ion perpendicular pressure should also increase by a factor of 2? In my 2D equatorial run with \(Bz=-5\) nT, at downstream \(Bz=-15\) nT, but the pressure anisotropy &#40;\(P_\perp / P_\parallel\)&#41; reaches ~20.

The instability is strongest for parallely propagating modes &#40;\(\theta_{kB_0} \sim 0^o\)&#41; and is weakly dependent on the ion \(\beta\). The mode is left-hand polarized at parallel propagation in the plasma rest frame, being cyclotron resonant with the ions. Maximum growth corresponds to wave numbers \(k \simeq 0.5 - \omega_{pp}/c\), where \(\omega_{pp}\) is the proton plasma frequency.</p> <p>Ion-cyclotron wave can be derived in a Hall MHD framework: it comes as one of the two solutions from the dispersion relation, the other being electron-cyclotron wave, more commonly known as whistler wave. In Schwartz&#39;s review paper, he always wrote Alfvén/ion-cyclotron modes together, most likely to stress the fact that ion-cyclotron wave is left-hand polarized.</p> <p><a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3dh4j07v">A dissertation on EMIC waves in the Earth’s Magnetosphere</a></p> <p>The waves are generally believed to be generated in the equatorial magnetosphere by</p> <ul> <li><p>ion-cyclotron resonance with unstable distributions of energetic ring current ions during the recovery phase of magnetic storms</p> <li><p>during compressions of the day-side magnetopause &#40;???

However, there is no clear consensus on a dominant mechanism. These are important questions since EMIC waves may control the precipitation of energetic ions and relativistic electrons.</p> <p>Plasma density is one of the most important parameters controlling EMIC wave generation. Growth models which assume the total plasma is dominated by thermal plasma may not relate to regions where both cold plasmaspheric plasma and ring current ions are important.</p> <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2008JA013494">Gamayunov and Khazanov, 2008</a> using a global RCEMIC simulation model suggests that suprathermal plasma plays a role in destabilizing the more energetic ring current and/or plasma sheet distributions to a high energy anisotropy. It also suggests that for best data comparison the EMICW source is located at the equator and that waves reflect at off-equatorial latitudes at the bi-ion hybrid frequencies in conjugate hemispheres.</p> <p>self-written model, no name, ray-tracing equations in plasma</p> <p>Yoshiharu Omura and his students once had a proceeding about <em>Competition Between the Mirror Mode Instability and the L-Mode Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron Instability</em>. They performend hybrid 1D-3D simulations and tried to explain the observation that mirror instability dominates the L-mode EMIC instability in the Earth&#39;s magnetosheath. This is puzzling since the EMIC instability generally has higher linear growth rate than that of the mirror instability.</p> <p><a href="&#40;https://doi.org/10.1029/2008JA014038&#41;">Shoji&#43;2009</a></p> <p>During the linear stage, they found that EMIC waves saturates at an earlier stage in higher dimensions, and mirror mode wave can gain more free energy from the temperature anisotropy.</p> <p>During the nonlinear stage:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the 3D case mirror mode coalescence is much more rapid.

However, later people have found that the same can be triggered by solar wind dynamic pressure fluctuation. Simultaneous measurements are applied to show that periodic fluctuations in the solar wind dynamic pressure drives ULF pulsations in the magnetosphere. A one‐to‐one correspondence was observed between the solar wind number density oscillation frequencies and oscillation frequencies in dayside magnetic field measurements from the GOES satellite.

The slopes of the curves \(\delta E∕\delta B\) correspond to the wave propagation speed in the spacecraft frame.</p> <p>Transverse and shear Alfvén wave refer to actually the same thing: the descriptions arise from \(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{V} = 0\) and \(\mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{B}_0 = 0\).</p> <p>The fast and slow magnetosonic waves are associated with non-zero perturbations in the plasma density and pressure, and also involve plasma motion parallel, as well as perpendicular, to the magnetic field. The latter observation suggests that the dispersion relations \(\omega = kV_{\pm}\) are likely to undergo significant modification in collisionless plasmas. In order to better understand the nature of the fast and slow waves, let us consider the cold-plasma limit, which is obtained by letting the sound speed \(V_S\) tend to zero. In this limit, the slow wave ceases to exist &#40;in fact, its phase velocity tends to zero&#41; whereas the dispersion relation for the fast wave reduces to</p> \[ \omega = kV_A. \] <p>This can be identified as the dispersion relation for the compressional-Alfvén wave. Thus, we can identify the fast wave as the compressional-Alfvén wave modified by a non-zero plasma pressure.</p> <p>In the limit \(V_A\gg V_S\), which is appropriate to low-β plasmas, the dispersion relation for the slow wave reduces to</p> \[ \omega \simeq k\,V_S\,\cos\theta. \] <p>This is actually the dispersion relation of a sound wave propagating along magnetic field-lines. Thus, in low-β plasmas the slow wave is a sound wave modified by the presence of the magnetic field.</p> <p>In reality, waves can be mixed together with mode conversions. Also, notice that the classical wave theory is based on spatially homogeneous plasma assumption, which is rarely the case in nature such as the magnetosphere.</p> <p>A tricky part in practice is how to get the average through smoothing. Note that a real satellite moves both in time and space. Usually people do moving-box-average to get an average state within a short period.</p> <p>A more careful analysis is called Walén test.</p> <p>However, always keep in mind that the most reliable way of identifying waves is to calculate the dispersion relation.</p> <h3 id=polarization_analysis ><a href="#polarization_analysis" class=header-anchor >Polarization analysis</a></h3> <p>Singular Value Decomposition &#40;SVD&#41;: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JA020469">Lee &amp; Angelopoulos</a></p> <p>hodogram of field components</p> <h3 id=mean_field_aligned_coordinates ><a href="#mean_field_aligned_coordinates" class=header-anchor >Mean field aligned coordinates</a></h3> <p>The magnetic field satellite data are usually referred to geocentric coordinate reference frames such as geocentric solar ecliptic &#40;GSE&#41; frame. Conversely, the MHD waves modes in magnetized plasma depend on the ambient magnetic field, and is then useful to rotate the magnetic field measurements into the <em>mean field-aligned &#40;MFA&#41; coordinate system</em>. This reference frame is useful to study the ultra-low frequency magnetic field variations along and perpendicular to the direction of the mean field. </p> <p>The MFA coordinate system is a local coordinate system that relates to the geomagnetic field. In the ecliptic plane, the parallel direction is more or less aligned with z in GSE, the first perpendicular direction pointing from Earth to the region of interest, and the second perpendicular direction completing the right hand rule. </p> <p>In order to identify the mean magnetic field the classical moving average &#40;MAVG&#41; approach is usually adopted, but does not always give reliable performance. In the solarwind, a technique widely used to study parallel and perpendicular magnetic field components of waves is the minimum variance analysis &#40;MVA&#41;. However, the minimum variance direction does not necessarily coincide with that of the ambient magnetic field.</p> <p>If a time scale separation exists within the magnetic field measurements, these time series can be thought as a superposition of a slowly varying &#40;amplitude&#41; ambient field \(\mathbf{B}_0(t)\), an higher frequency signal \(\mathbf{b}(t)\)&#40;or perturbation&#41; and an incoherent noise \(\mathbf{n}(t)\):</p> \[ \mathbf{B}(t) = \mathbf{B}_0(t) + \mathbf{b}(t) + \mathbf{n}(t). \] <p><img src="/Ganymede/assets/MFA_coordinate_magnetosphere.png" alt=""> MFA coordinate system in the magnetosphere: the MFA directions \(\mathbf{\mu}\), \(\mathbf{\phi}\) and \(\mathbf{\nu}\) are showed together with the satellite position &#40;red dot&#41;.

The moving average &#40;MAVG&#41; is a good choice with respect to any low-pass filter, as it introduces no artifacts. However in applying the MAVG method it is assumed that the characteristic fluctuation time \(T_0\) related to \(\mathbf{B}_0(t)\) is much greater than the period \(T_b\) of the perturbation \(\mathbf{b}(t)\). Moreover, \(T_0\) depends on both satellite motion and natural magnetic field variation &#40;e.g. high velocity stream, coronal mass ejections, corotating interaction regions&#41;, and could be related to nonlinear and non stationary phenomena. Under these conditions the MAVG might be unsuitable in the rotation procedure, while a method such as the <em>empirical mode decomposition &#40;EMD&#41;</em>, is useful to identify nonlinear and nonstationary processes.</p> <p>This is discussed thoroughly in <a href=Regi2016 >Regi&#43;, 2016</a>.
