This is the reason why early pioneers in space physics relied on MHD theory for large spatial and temporal scales to explain the physics behind these waves, albeit some deviations and deficiencies which require more refined models such as the Vlasov description.</p> <h2 id=observation ><a href="#observation" class=header-anchor >Observation</a></h2> <p>ULF waves were originally called micropulsations or magnetic pulsations since they were first observed by ground magnetometers.

Referring to the basic MHD theory, the compressional modes are fast modes, whereas the poloidal and toriodal modes are Alfvén modes. The perturbed EM fields are related by \(\mathbf{B}_1 = \frac{\mathbf{k}}{\omega} \times \mathbf{E}_1\).

The eigen-value is usually taken to be the &#40;complex&#41; wave frequency \(\omega\), with the real wave-vector \(\mathbf{k}\) prescribed. The associated eigenvector is the set of fluctuating fields &#40;\(\delta\mathbf{E},\delta\mathbf{B}\)&#41; and plasma parameters &#40;\(\delta \rho, \delta\mathbf{u}, \delta P\) in the case of MHD or \(\delta f_j(\mathb f{v})\) for kinetic waves where j stands for each species&#41;. Mode identification is the process of comparing the observed eigenvalue/eigenvector with the possible theoretical ones and finding the one which matches.</p> <p>The practical implementation of mode identification is strewn with pitfalls and complications, including:</p> <ul> <li><p>There is usually a mixture, possibly phase-coherent, of modes and/or frequencies, rather than an isolated mode.</p> <li><p>Frequencies are often Doppler shifted by an unknown, or poorly known, amount.</p> <li><p>Wave vectors are difficult to determine from the one-&#40;or few-&#41; point measurements available from spacecraft.</p> <li><p>The mode eigenstate can depend sensitively on the wave vector, plasma \(\beta\), and temperature anisotropy, as well as on the contributions of multi-species or non-Maxwellian kinetic features.</p> <li><p>The temporal resolution and accuracy of some measurements, notably those related to particle populations and plasma moments, are often insufficient or marginal.

Steven has already envisioned two types of models &#40;decision tree, N-dimensional distance sampling&#41; in 1996. 20 years later, people would find it more appealing to use machine learning.</p> <p><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab9697">Medeiros&#43; 2020</a> introduces a machine learning model for recognizing EMICWs from spectrograms.

These are MHD Alfvén waves. </table> Electron and ion foreshocks are one typical ULF wave generation mechanism.</p> <p>When the magnetopause can be described as a tangential discontinuity &#40;\(B_n = 0\)&#41;, the MHD wave transmission is not efficient; when the magnetopause is a rotational discontinuity &#40;\(B_n\neq 0\)&#41;, MHD wave transmission can occur over a wide range of incident angle and that the transmitted waves are usually amplified. The favored ULF wave range may lie within Pc5.</p> <p>The correlation between solar wind speed and ULF power in the magnetosphere suggests that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability &#40;KHI&#41; resulting from the velocity shear at the magnetopause may be a significant source of ULF wave energy. KHI studies were very active in the 1980s, but since then nothing really significant has been reached.</p> <p>Boundary layer thickness –&gt; over-reflection modes at the magnetopause <em>Over-reflection</em> occurs when the characteristic scales of the wave and the inhomogeneity are comparable, and may provide an efficient process for the extraction of energy from the magnetosheath to magnetospheric waveguide modes on the flanks during fast solar wind speed intervals. This may explain the production of discrete frequency ULF waves in the magnetosphere and statistical correlations between Pc5 power on the ground and solar wind velocity</p> <p>Opinion: Alfvénic waves propagating along the magnetopause surface may develop into standing Alfvén waves on the boundary due to reflection from the conjugate ionospheres &#40;i.e. Kruskal-Schwarzschild modes&#41;. The surface waves are likely due to magnetopause displacements as a result of local pressure perturbations in the magnetosheath, while the eigenfrequencies of the standing modes are determined by the magnetopause geometry and are strikingly similar to the Samson &quot;magic&quot; frequencies. This combination of conditions suggests that the oscillations are more likely due to Kruskal-Schwarzshild modes than solar wind pressure perturbations or the KHI at the flanks.</p> <h4 id=pressure_variation ><a href="#pressure_variation" class=header-anchor >Pressure Variation</a></h4> <ol> <li><p>Solar wind dynamic pressure pulses identified by</p> </ol> <ul> <li><p>depressed magnetic field strength;</p> <li><p>enhanced plasma density;</p> <li><p>compressed magnetosphere;</p> <li><p>enhanced magnetic field strength observed by &quot;static&quot; satellites.</p> </ul> <p><a href="http://www.igpp.ucla.edu/people/mkivelson/Publications/116-JA095iA03p02301.pdf">Southwood and Kivelson</a> has described the basic picture of pressure viriations pretty well: &lt; The magnetosphere is not rigid; the plasma motions due to compression are not necessarily in phase. If a change in external pressure takes place on a time scale shorter than the time taken by a MHD wave to travel through the magnetospheric cavity &#40;~ 10 min&#41;, the magnetopause acts as a source of a compressional MHD signal that propagates through the system. As well as communicating the new equilibrium conditions, the signal can excite transient responses, for example normal modes. The magnetosphere as a whole can ring &#40;a global compressional mode response&#41; or ringing may be confined to certain selected shells &#40;field resonance&#41;. Even where the global mode is not excited there is still a response away from the resonant shell. In this case the response will more directly reflect the form of the applied pressure changes as the signal will not be contaminated by the presence of an oscillatory transient associated with a normal mode response.</p> <p>There is also an ionospheric response, but I don&#39;t know the details.</p> <p>The typical pressure perturbation, be it periodic or an impulsive or stepwise change, will exhibit some structure, e.g., a front or a series of phase fronts that moves systematically away from the Sun. The schematic figure shows a series of pictures illustrating the motion of an isolated pressure pulse over the magnetopause. A ridge moves over the magnetopause away from the subsolar point. In the sketch there is a single front within which the magnetopause moves in and out producing a compressional change of limited extent. As the compression sweeps around the magnetopause the pressure perturbation imposed on the magnetosphere has both a characteristic spatial scale size, L, and time, T, linked by the relation</p> \[ T \approx L / U \] <p>where U is the speed along the boundary. We must allow for a spatial structure that is imposed by the perturbation and it is also clear that the motion of the perturbation is both along and across the magnetic field. As mentioned later in the paper, the scale length perpendicular to the field is of some significance in determining the type of magnetospheric response. We shall parametrize the variation imposed at the boundary by assuming that a given perturbation may be made up of a collection &#40;potentially infinite&#41; of spatial Fourier components and we shall describe the response to a specific Fourier component. In a similar spirit we shall use Laplace transforms to describe the temporal structure of the perturbation. However, we shall need to switch from frequency domain to time domain as we outline the types of system response and so we shall have to treat the variation more rigorously in time than in space.</p> <img src="/Ganymede/assets/magnetopause_pressure_pulse.png" alt=""> <p>One possible physical process is that the pressure pulses first strike the magnetopause and then launched sunward moving boundary waves on the magnetopause.</p> <ol start=2 > <li><p>Pressure pulses can also be generated in the foreshock region as a result of the instability due to ions backstreaming from the shock.</p> </ol> <ul> <li><p>The density perturbations in this case often have a positive correlation with magnetic fields.</p> </ul> <p>The impact of pressure pulses on the magnetopause is known to be related to traveling convection vortices, flux transfer events,and auroral activities.</p> <h3 id=internal_drivers ><a href="#internal_drivers" class=header-anchor >Internal Drivers</a></h3> <p>Within the magnetosphere, there are two possible mechanics:</p> <ul> <li><p>drift-mirror instabilities &#40;?&#41; due to high \(\beta\) pressure anisotropies</p> <li><p>drift-bounce resonance &#40;?&#41; with trapped energetic ions</p> </ul> <p>From observation, \(T_\perp / T_\parallel > 5\) is practically treated as high anisotropies.</p> <p>strongly compressional, high azimuthal wave number m, attenuated on the ground.</p> <p>From the energy perspective, it is important to estimate how much energy FLRs deposit into the ionosphere, the energy dissipated into the ionosphere via Joule heating.</p> <h2 id=wave_generation_and_propagation_mechanisms ><a href="#wave_generation_and_propagation_mechanisms" class=header-anchor >Wave Generation and Propagation Mechanisms</a></h2> <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-0501-2_13">Menk, 2011</a>的综述文章只能硬着头皮看。太多从文章中抄出来的经验性总结了,对于入门新手极不友好。</p> <p>David Southwood, Margy Kivelson, and Steven Schwartz have done a lot in this field.</p> <p>Quote from Steven Schwartz&#39;s paper:</p> <blockquote> <p>For most aspects of space plasmas, and certainly for the waves observed in the magnetosheath, fluid-based descriptions of any kind are inadequate, particularly under the \(\beta > 1\) conditions found there.

Several kinds of instabilities can be triggered: mirror mode instability and L-mode electromagnetic ion-cyclotron instability &#40;EMIC&#41;. EMIC mode dominates when the plasma β is low while mirror mode dominates when the plasma β is high. Slow modes may also be present within a transition layer close to the subsolar magnetopause, although they are expected to suffer strong damping. These instabilities, if exist, allow energy transfer from the plasma to the electromagnetic field and creates the waves via reducing the temperature anisotropy and creating magnetic field oscillations for the mirror instability. So in a sense the instability initiates the waves, and the waves are these oscillations once they are &quot;established&quot; in the plasma.</p> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:heating"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:heating">[3]</a> <td class=fndef-content >Yuxi provides me with a nice starting point to think about this. The 1st adiabatic invariant, i.e. magnetic moment \(\mu_m = \frac{1}{2}m v_\perp^2 / B\) is almost conserved if the gyromotion is not violated. Across the quasi-perpendicular shock, the strength of the magnetic field increases, so the perpendicular thermal velocities must increase to maintain the magnetic moment. Therefore the perpendicular direction is preferentially heated downstream of the shock. For example, if the B field is increased by a factor of 2, then the ion perpendicular thermal velocity should increase by a factor of \(\sqrt{2}\), and the ion perpendicular pressure should also increase by a factor of 2? Never or less, keep in mind that in CGL theory we need at least 1 quantity from downstream besides the full upstream information to determine the downstream anisotropy &#40;see more in the shock note&#41;. </table> <h3 id=isotropic_mhd_waves ><a href="#isotropic_mhd_waves" class=header-anchor >Isotropic MHD waves</a></h3> <h4 id=fastslow_wave ><a href="#fastslow_wave" class=header-anchor >Fast/Slow wave</a></h4> <p>In linearized ideal isotropic MHD, fast, slow, and Alfvén mode are all linearly dispersive, i.e. phase velocity independent of the wavelength.</p> <p>compressive, \(P_B\) and \(P_t\) in phase for fast mode and in anti-phase for slow mode</p> <p>fast mode nearly isotropic for phase speed, while the slow mode is strongly guided by magnetic field direction</p> <p>Theoretically, slow and fast MHD waves usually are quickly damped in collisionless plasmas with moderate to high plasma β &#40;Barnes, 1966&#41;, leaving only outward propagating Alfvén waves.</p> <p>Fast mode: ion/ion right-hand resonant</p> <h4 id="alfvén_wave"><a href="#alfvén_wave" class=header-anchor >Alfvén wave</a></h4> <p>non-compressive, travels along the magnetic field, i.e. group velocity is field-aligned, \(\delta{u} \parallel \delta{\mathbf{B}}\)</p> <p>ion/ion left-hand resonant</p> <h4 id=entropy_wave ><a href="#entropy_wave" class=header-anchor >Entropy wave</a></h4> <p>There is a 4th zero-frequency mode from MHD theory, referred to as entropy mode, which is often ignored.

It was early recognized that this mode for being excited require a transverse pressure &#40;or temperature&#41; anisotropy.<a href="#footnote-anisotropy_source" class=footnote >[anisotropy_source]</a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19660020059/">Rudakov &amp; Sagdeyev</a> explained its physics using fluid approach in a paper written in Russian.</p> <p> This instability has generally been called mirror instability because a loss cone distribution inherently creates such an anisotropic pressure. It is actually not quite relevant in the mirror fusion machine because it has never become a high-β machine. For a complete theoretical derivation, I must read the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1692407">classical Hasegawa paper</a>.</p> <p>In 1967, Masayoshi Tajiri derived a kinetic description of the mirror mode when considering the propagation of linear &#40;i.e. small amplitude&#41; MHD waves in a collisionless plasma under homogeneous background. The key difference when compared against the CGL fluid approach is that is mirror mode is shown to be an <strong>non-oscillating</strong> mode with vanishing real part of the frequency, which means that it has zero frequency in the plasma rest frame. Under proper conditions, the non-oscillating wave causes the mirror instability in the direction nearly <strong>perpendicular</strong> to a magnetic field.</p> <p>In 1969, Akira Hasegawa extend the kinetic theory to a nonuniform medium which takes magnetic field gradient and finite-Larmor-radius effect into account. If we consider finite Larmor radius &#40;FLR&#41; effect, then the mirror mode becomes a <em>drift</em> mirror instability, which leads to the \(r^2_L \nabla^2\) term in the drift velocity. The Larmor radius is much larger for ions than for electrons, so the drift will create charge separation and electric fields. If we consider inhomogeneity, the non-propagation is also no longer true.</p> <p>Since the magnetic field in mirror modes forms extended though slightly oblique magnetic bottles, low parallel energy particles can be trapped in mirror modes and redistribute energy. Such trapped electrons excite banded whistler wave emission known under the name of lion roars and indicating that the mirror modes contain a trapped particle component while leading to the splitting of particle distributions into trapped and passing particles. The most amazing fact about mirror modes is, however, that they evolve in the practically fully collisionless regime of high temperature plasma where it is on thermodynamic reasons entirely impossible to expel any magnetic field from the plasma.<sup id="fnref:question"><a href="#fndef:question" class=fnref >[4]</a></sup> The fact that magnetic fields are indeed locally extracted makes mirror modes similar to “superconducting” structures in matter as known only at extremely low temperatures. Of course, microscopic quantum effects do not play a role in mirror modes. However, it seems that all mirror structures have typical scales of the order of the ion inertial length which implies that mirrors evolve in a regime where the transverse ion and electron motions decouple. In this case the Hall kinetics comes into play.</p> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:question"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:question">[4]</a> <td class=fndef-content >how should I interpret this sentence? Mirror modes cause some structuring of the plasma thus generating a state of lower entropy than the initial state. Moreover, the plasma is ideally conducting which implies that plasma and magnetic field are frozen and cannot be separated from each other. One therefore has to find a mechanism which distorts both the frozen-in state and leads to lower entropy without violating the second theromodynamics law, in other words, the lower entropy state has to be a state of reduced free energy. </table> <h4 id=ambiguity_about_mirror_modes ><a href="#ambiguity_about_mirror_modes" class=header-anchor >Ambiguity about mirror modes</a></h4> <p>Mirror mode oscillation is the lowest frequency <strong>perpendicular</strong> magnetic excitation in magnetized plasma. In principle mirror modes are some version of slow mode waves, i.e. the density and magnetic field fluctuations are in strict anti-phase. Fluid theory, however, does not give a correct physical picture of the mirror mode. As the lowest frequency mode it can be expected that mirror modes serve as one of the dominant energy inputs into plasma. This is however true only when the mode grows to large amplitude leaving the linear stage.<a href="https://npg.copernicus.org/articles/11/647/2004/npg-11-647-2004.pdf">Treumann&#43;, 2004</a></p> <p>At such low frequencies, on the other hand, quasilinear theory does not apply as a valid saturation mechanism. Probably the dominant processes are related to the generation of gradients in the plasma which serve as the cause of drift modes thus transferring energy to shorter wavelength propagating waves of higher nonzero frequency. This kind of theory has not yet been developed as it has not yet been understood why mirror modes in spite of their slow growth rate usually are of very large amplitudes indeed of the order of \(|B/B_0|^2\sim O(1)\).</p> <p>Quasilinear theory predicts the reduction of the initial ion pressure anisotropy towards stabilization up to a minimum required for keeping the final state. Though this seems to be quite reasonable, the validity of the theory is strongly questionable because the mirror mode is a non-oscillatory wave mode of small growth rate such that averaging over the period of the wave oscillation becomes spurious. There is plenty of time for other higher frequency instabilities to develop feeded by either the plasma anisotropy or by the plasma gradients self-consistently generated by the linear mirror mode itself in the plasma. In the first case one expects ion cyclotron instabilities to arise, in the second case short-wavelength high-frequency drift instabilities should evolve rapidly destroying the mirror mode.</p> <p>More questions arise when thinking about mirror modes.</p> <ol> <li><p>In plasma with temperature &#40;pressure&#41; anisotropy \(A = T_\perp/T_\parallel > 1\) required for mirror modes to exist, Alfvén waves remain stable and cannot be excited unless some peculiar mechanism &#40;like fast field aligned ion beams propagating across the plasma or local field-aligned electric potential drops serving as sources of Alfvén waves&#41; is at work. Neither of such mechanisms exists in the magnetosheath.</p> <li><p>Observations show that the structures do not appear isolated but in chains of many closely located magnetic depressions separated by intense magnetic walls.</p> <li><p>Their magnetic field polarization is entirely parallel with negligible transverse magnetic components, indicating that</p> </ol> <p>their phase velocities are very close to being perpendicular which is in striking contrast to Alfvénic structures where the compressional component can be neglected.<sup id="fnref:mystery"><a href="#fndef:mystery" class=fnref >[5]</a></sup></p> <ol start=4 > <li><p>Investigation of the particle components inside the mirror structures suggests that they contain trapped particle components which are the signature of a mirror configuration which confines the low energy component to the region of magnetic field depression. This low energy zero parallel velocity component is crucial in formation of mirror modes &#40;as has been realized first by Southwood and Kivelson, 1993&#41; since it is the one which is in resonance.</p> </ol> <p><table class=fndef  id="fndef:mystery"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:mystery">[5]</a> <td class=fndef-content >This is one of the most confusing point when I thought that mirror mode was just one kind of slow mode. Slow mode in MHD propagate preferably in the parallel direction, which is the opposite of mirror mode. This strange property also indicates that in GSM coordinates of the magnetosheath, we shall look at Bz perturbation for mirror mode, especially in low latitude regions. </table> From this discussion it follows that the mere existence of mirror mode structures is a somewhat strange fact, in particular because in high temperature plasma a large number of oscillation modes like drift waves may arise which will fatally affect the evolution of mirror modes. However the existence of mirror bubbles suggests that they themselves represent a lowest frequency quasi-stationary mode that may evolve in a high temperature plasma leading to a distinct spatial structuring of the plasma both in the magnetic field as in the plasma pressure and densities. Mirror modes in their nonlinear state thus represent a state of minimum free energy in an anisotropic high temperature plasma with excess transverse temperature. Since structures of this kind have very low phase velocity \(\omega/k \approx 0\) in the plasma frame they are subject to convection along with the plasma itself. Their frequency in the spacecraft frame is given by \(\omega_{sc}\approx \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}\) causing distinct frequency power spectra \(P(\omega_{sc})\) which map the wavelength spectrum \(P(\mathbf{k})\) of the mirror modes into the frequency domain.</p> <h4 id=properties ><a href="#properties" class=header-anchor >Properties</a></h4> <p>See a nice review in the section &quot;Summary of linear theory&quot; in <a href="https://npg.copernicus.org/articles/11/647/2004/npg-11-647-2004.pdf">Treumann&#43;, 2004</a>.</p> <p>The energy source of the mirror mode is the pressure &#40;or temperature&#41; anisotropy of the ions.

The ion cyclotron instability also occurs at frequencies below the ion gyrofrequency in the presence of ion pitch angle anisotropy, which mostly overlaps with the mirror instability.

The latter observation suggests that the dispersion relations \(\omega = kV_{\pm}\) are likely to undergo significant modification in collisionless plasmas. In order to better understand the nature of the fast and slow waves, let us consider the cold-plasma limit, which is obtained by letting the sound speed \(V_S\) tend to zero. In this limit, the slow wave ceases to exist &#40;in fact, its phase velocity tends to zero&#41; whereas the dispersion relation for the fast wave reduces to</p> \[ \omega = kV_A. \] <p>This can be identified as the dispersion relation for the compressional-Alfvén wave. Thus, we can identify the fast wave as the compressional-Alfvén wave modified by a non-zero plasma pressure.</p> <p>In the limit \(V_A\gg V_S\), which is appropriate to low-β plasmas, the dispersion relation for the slow wave reduces to</p> \[ \omega \simeq k\,V_S\,\cos\theta. \] <p>This is actually the dispersion relation of a sound wave propagating along magnetic field-lines. Thus, in low-β plasmas the slow wave is a sound wave modified by the presence of the magnetic field.</p> <p>In reality, waves can be mixed together with mode conversions. Also, notice that the classical wave theory is based on spatially homogeneous plasma assumption, which is rarely the case in nature such as the magnetosphere.</p> <p>A tricky part in practice is how to get the average through smoothing. Note that a real satellite moves both in time and space. Usually people do moving-box-average to get an average state within a short period.</p> <p>A more careful analysis is called Walén test.</p> <p>However, always keep in mind that the most reliable way of identifying waves is to calculate the dispersion relation.</p> <h3 id=polarization_analysis ><a href="#polarization_analysis" class=header-anchor >Polarization analysis</a></h3> <p>Singular Value Decomposition &#40;SVD&#41;: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JA020469">Lee &amp; Angelopoulos</a></p> <p>hodogram of field components</p> <h3 id=wave_vector_direction ><a href="#wave_vector_direction" class=header-anchor >Wave vector direction</a></h3> <p>The direction of the wave vector can be estimated using MVA on the measured magnetic field.

Conversely, the MHD waves modes in magnetized plasma depend on the ambient magnetic field, and is then useful to rotate the magnetic field measurements into the <em>mean field-aligned &#40;MFA&#41; coordinate system</em>. This reference frame is useful to study the ultra-low frequency magnetic field variations along and perpendicular to the direction of the mean field. </p> <p>The MFA coordinate system is a local coordinate system that relates to the geomagnetic field. In the ecliptic plane, the parallel direction is more or less aligned with z in GSE, the first perpendicular direction pointing from Earth to the region of interest, and the second perpendicular direction completing the right hand rule. </p> <p>In order to identify the mean magnetic field the classical moving average &#40;MAVG&#41; approach is usually adopted, but does not always give reliable performance. In the solarwind, a technique widely used to study parallel and perpendicular magnetic field components of waves is the minimum variance analysis &#40;MVA&#41;. However, the minimum variance direction does not necessarily coincide with that of the ambient magnetic field.</p> <p>If a time scale separation exists within the magnetic field measurements, these time series can be thought as a superposition of a slowly varying &#40;amplitude&#41; ambient field \(\mathbf{B}_0(t)\), an higher frequency signal \(\mathbf{b}(t)\)&#40;or perturbation&#41; and an incoherent noise \(\mathbf{n}(t)\):</p> \[ \mathbf{B}(t) = \mathbf{B}_0(t) + \mathbf{b}(t) + \mathbf{n}(t). \] <p><img src="/Ganymede/assets/MFA_coordinate_magnetosphere.png" alt=""> MFA coordinate system in the magnetosphere: the MFA directions \(\mathbf{\mu}\), \(\mathbf{\phi}\) and \(\mathbf{\nu}\) are showed together with the satellite position &#40;red dot&#41;.

The moving average &#40;MAVG&#41; is a good choice with respect to any low-pass filter, as it introduces no artifacts. However in applying the MAVG method it is assumed that the characteristic fluctuation time \(T_0\) related to \(\mathbf{B}_0(t)\) is much greater than the period \(T_b\) of the perturbation \(\mathbf{b}(t)\). Moreover, \(T_0\) depends on both satellite motion and natural magnetic field variation &#40;e.g. high velocity stream, coronal mass ejections, corotating interaction regions&#41;, and could be related to nonlinear and non stationary phenomena.
