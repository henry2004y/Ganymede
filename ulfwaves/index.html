The name does not tell us anything about their physical origin, but simply observational fact. At Earth&#39;s magnetosphere, this frequency range overlaps largely with the MHD waves. This is the reason why early pioneers in space physics relied on MHD theory for large spatial and temporal scales to explain the physics behind these waves, albeit some deviations and deficiencies which require more refined models such as the Vlasov description.</p> <h2 id=observation ><a href="#observation" class=header-anchor >Observation</a></h2> <p>ULF waves were originally called micropulsations or magnetic pulsations since they were first observed by ground magnetometers. ULF pulsations are classified into two types: <em>pulsations continuous &#40;Pc&#41;</em> and <em>pulsations irregular &#40;Pi&#41;</em> with several subclasses &#40;Pc1–5 and Pi1–2&#41; according to their frequencies and durations.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class=fnref >[1]</a></sup></p> <table><tr><th align=right >Notation<th align=right >Period Range &#91;s&#93;<tr><td align=right >Pc1<td align=right >0.2 - 5<tr><td align=right >Pc2<td align=right >5 - 10<tr><td align=right >Pc3<td align=right >10 - 45<tr><td align=right >Pc4<td align=right >45 - 150<tr><td align=right >Pc5<td align=right >150 - 600<tr><td align=right ><td align=right ><tr><td align=right >Pi1<td align=right >1 - 40<tr><td align=right >Pi2<td align=right >40 - 150</table> <p><table class=fndef  id="fndef:1"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:1">[1]</a> <td class=fndef-content >The Pc5 range originates from the Mariner 5 &#40;1967&#41; detection limitation to a Nyquist frequency of 1.67mHz, which corresponds to 600s. It roughly maps to \(60^o\sim 70^o\) latitude on Earth&#39;s surface. </table> With respect to polarization, field line resonant ULF waves can be categorized into three modes: <em>compressional</em> &#40;\(\Delta B_\parallel,\, \Delta E_\phi\)&#41;, <em>poloidal</em> &#40;\(\Delta B_r,\, \Delta E_\phi\)&#41;, and <em>toroidal</em> &#40;\(\Delta B_\phi,\, \Delta E_r\)&#41;. Here, \(B_r\) &#40;\(E_r\)&#41;, \(B_\parallel\), and \(B_\phi\) &#40;\(E_\phi\)&#41; are the radial, parallel &#40;or compressional&#41;, and azimuthal components in the local magnetic field system, respectively. Referring to the basic MHD theory, the compressional modes are fast modes, whereas the poloidal and toriodal modes are Alfvén modes. The perturbed EM fields are related by \(\mathbf{B}_1 = \frac{\mathbf{k}}{\omega} \times \mathbf{E}_1\). Think of a closed field line near the equatorial plane inside the magnetosphere: if the wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\) is along the field line, i.e. \(\mathbf{k} = (0,0,k_z)\), then there will be two cases for the EM field: poloidal where \(\mathbf{E}_1\) in \(\hat{\phi}\), \(\mathbf{B}_1\) in \(\hat{r}\) and toroidal where \(\mathbf{E}_1\) in \(\hat{r}\), \(\mathbf{B}_1\) in \(\hat{\phi}\). If the wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\) is perpendicular to the field line, i.e. \(\mathbf{k} = (k_x, 0, 0)\), since there is no \(E_\parallel\) in MHD, we only have one option \(\mathbf{E}_1\) in \(\hat{\phi}\) and \(\mathbf{B}_1\) in \(\hat{z}\). A phase shift is allowed, and actually in real observations &#40;e.g. THEMIS&#41; it is rare that you can find B and E changing in-phase.</p> <img src="/Ganymede/assets/Menk2013_Fig17_poloidal_toroidal.png" alt=""> <ol> <li><p>discrete magic frequencies</p> </ol> <p>Field line resonance &#40;FLR&#41;, which is phenonmenon about standing Alfvén waves excited on geomagnetic field lines &#40;i.e closed field lines whose foot points lie in the ionosphere&#41;, are observed in the Pc5 range, with discrete frequencies at approximately 1.3, 1.9, 2.6, and 3.4 mHz.</p> <ol start=2 > <li><p>Pc1 sudden impulses</p> </ol> <ul> <li><p>local noon-afternoon, easily detectable when following sudden impulses &#40;SI&#41; produced by sudden changes in the pressure of the solar wind plasma.</p> <li><p>A sudden compression of the magnetosphere by increased solar wind pressure causes maximum distortion of the quiet magnetospheric plasma near noon at high latitudes.

The eigen-value is usually taken to be the &#40;complex&#41; wave frequency \(\omega\), with the real wave-vector \(\mathbf{k}\) prescribed. The associated eigenvector is the set of fluctuating fields &#40;\(\delta\mathbf{E},\delta\mathbf{B}\)&#41; and plasma parameters &#40;\(\delta \rho, \delta\mathbf{u}, \delta P\) in the case of MHD or \(\delta f_j(\mathbf{v})\) for kinetic waves where j stands for each species&#41;. Mode identification is the process of comparing the observed eigenvalue/eigenvector with the possible theoretical ones and finding the one which matches.</p> <p>The practical implementation of mode identification is strewn with pitfalls and complications, including:</p> <ul> <li><p>There is usually a mixture, possibly phase-coherent, of modes and/or frequencies, rather than an isolated mode.</p> <li><p>Frequencies are often Doppler shifted by an unknown, or poorly known, amount.</p> <li><p>Wave vectors are difficult to determine from the one-&#40;or few-&#41; point measurements available from spacecraft.</p> <li><p>The mode eigenstate can depend sensitively on the wave vector, plasma \(\beta\), and temperature anisotropy, as well as on the contributions of multi-species or non-Maxwellian kinetic features.</p> <li><p>The temporal resolution and accuracy of some measurements, notably those related to particle populations and plasma moments, are often insufficient or marginal. Some important species or sub-population may not be measured at all. The result is that either or both the background state or fluctuations are not accurately known.</p> <li><p>Wave amplitudes are often large &#40;of order unity&#41;, implying nonlinear processes may be present and distort the eigenstate from its linear form, or give rise to intrinsically nonlinear eigenstates.</p> <li><p>Similarly, inhomogeneities can distort the wave propagation or eigenstate in ways which have largely been unexplored.</p> <li><p>As we have seen, the theoretical wave properties depend on the framework in which the theory is performed.

Steven has already envisioned two types of models &#40;decision tree, N-dimensional distance sampling&#41; in 1996. 20 years later, people would find it more appealing to use machine learning.</p> <p><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab9697">Medeiros&#43; 2020</a> introduces a machine learning model for recognizing EMICWs from spectrograms.

These are MHD Alfvén waves. </table> Electron and ion foreshocks are one typical ULF wave generation mechanism.</p> <p>When the magnetopause can be described as a tangential discontinuity &#40;\(B_n = 0\)&#41;, the MHD wave transmission is not efficient; when the magnetopause is a rotational discontinuity &#40;\(B_n\neq 0\)&#41;, MHD wave transmission can occur over a wide range of incident angle and that the transmitted waves are usually amplified. The favored ULF wave range may lie within Pc5.</p> <p>The correlation between solar wind speed and ULF power in the magnetosphere suggests that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability &#40;KHI&#41; resulting from the velocity shear at the magnetopause may be a significant source of ULF wave energy. KHI studies were very active in the 1980s, but since then nothing really significant has been reached.</p> <p>Boundary layer thickness –&gt; over-reflection modes at the magnetopause <em>Over-reflection</em> occurs when the characteristic scales of the wave and the inhomogeneity are comparable, and may provide an efficient process for the extraction of energy from the magnetosheath to magnetospheric waveguide modes on the flanks during fast solar wind speed intervals. This may explain the production of discrete frequency ULF waves in the magnetosphere and statistical correlations between Pc5 power on the ground and solar wind velocity</p> <p>Opinion: Alfvénic waves propagating along the magnetopause surface may develop into standing Alfvén waves on the boundary due to reflection from the conjugate ionospheres &#40;i.e. Kruskal-Schwarzschild modes&#41;. The surface waves are likely due to magnetopause displacements as a result of local pressure perturbations in the magnetosheath, while the eigenfrequencies of the standing modes are determined by the magnetopause geometry and are strikingly similar to the Samson &quot;magic&quot; frequencies. This combination of conditions suggests that the oscillations are more likely due to Kruskal-Schwarzshild modes than solar wind pressure perturbations or the KHI at the flanks.</p> <h4 id=pressure_variation ><a href="#pressure_variation" class=header-anchor >Pressure Variation</a></h4> <ol> <li><p>Solar wind dynamic pressure pulses identified by</p> </ol> <ul> <li><p>depressed magnetic field strength</p> <li><p>enhanced plasma density</p> <li><p>compressed magnetosphere</p> <li><p>enhanced magnetic field strength observed by &quot;static&quot; satellites</p> </ul> <p><a href="http://www.igpp.ucla.edu/people/mkivelson/Publications/116-JA095iA03p02301.pdf">Southwood and Kivelson</a> has described the basic picture of pressure viriations pretty well: &lt; The magnetosphere is not rigid; the plasma motions due to compression are not necessarily in phase. If a change in external pressure takes place on a time scale shorter than the time taken by a MHD wave to travel through the magnetospheric cavity &#40;~ 10 min&#41;, the magnetopause acts as a source of a compressional MHD signal that propagates through the system. As well as communicating the new equilibrium conditions, the signal can excite transient responses, for example normal modes. The magnetosphere as a whole can ring &#40;a global compressional mode response&#41; or ringing may be confined to certain selected shells &#40;field resonance&#41;. Even where the global mode is not excited there is still a response away from the resonant shell. In this case the response will more directly reflect the form of the applied pressure changes as the signal will not be contaminated by the presence of an oscillatory transient associated with a normal mode response.</p> <p>There is also an ionospheric response, but I don&#39;t know the details.</p> <p>The typical pressure perturbation, be it periodic or an impulsive or stepwise change, will exhibit some structure, e.g., a front or a series of phase fronts that moves systematically away from the Sun. The schematic figure shows a series of pictures illustrating the motion of an isolated pressure pulse over the magnetopause. A ridge moves over the magnetopause away from the subsolar point. In the sketch there is a single front within which the magnetopause moves in and out producing a compressional change of limited extent. As the compression sweeps around the magnetopause the pressure perturbation imposed on the magnetosphere has both a characteristic spatial scale size, L, and time, T, linked by the relation</p> \[ T \approx L / U \] <p>where U is the speed along the boundary. We must allow for a spatial structure that is imposed by the perturbation and it is also clear that the motion of the perturbation is both along and across the magnetic field. As mentioned later in the paper, the scale length perpendicular to the field is of some significance in determining the type of magnetospheric response. We shall parametrize the variation imposed at the boundary by assuming that a given perturbation may be made up of a collection &#40;potentially infinite&#41; of spatial Fourier components and we shall describe the response to a specific Fourier component. In a similar spirit we shall use Laplace transforms to describe the temporal structure of the perturbation. However, we shall need to switch from frequency domain to time domain as we outline the types of system response and so we shall have to treat the variation more rigorously in time than in space.</p> <img src="/Ganymede/assets/magnetopause_pressure_pulse.png" alt=""> <p>One possible physical process is that the pressure pulses first strike the magnetopause and then launched sunward moving boundary waves on the magnetopause.</p> <ol start=2 > <li><p>Pressure pulses can also be generated in the foreshock region as a result of the instability due to ions backstreaming from the shock.</p> </ol> <ul> <li><p>The density perturbations in this case often have a positive correlation with magnetic fields.</p> </ul> <p>The impact of pressure pulses on the magnetopause is known to be related to traveling convection vortices, flux transfer events,and auroral activities.</p> <h3 id=internal_drivers ><a href="#internal_drivers" class=header-anchor >Internal Drivers</a></h3> <p>Within the magnetosphere, there are two possible mechanics:</p> <ul> <li><p>drift-mirror instabilities &#40;?&#41; due to high \(\beta\) pressure anisotropies</p> <li><p>drift-bounce resonance &#40;?&#41; with trapped energetic ions</p> </ul> <p>From observation, \(T_\perp / T_\parallel > 5\) is practically treated as high anisotropies.</p> <p>strongly compressional, high azimuthal wave number m, attenuated on the ground.</p> <p>From the energy perspective, it is important to estimate how much energy FLRs deposit into the ionosphere, the energy dissipated into the ionosphere via Joule heating.</p> <h2 id=wave_generation_and_propagation_mechanisms ><a href="#wave_generation_and_propagation_mechanisms" class=header-anchor >Wave Generation and Propagation Mechanisms</a></h2> <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-0501-2_13">Menk, 2011</a>的综述文章只能硬着头皮看。太多从文章中抄出来的经验性总结了,对于入门新手极不友好。</p> <p>David Southwood, Margy Kivelson, and Steven Schwartz have done a lot in this field.</p> <p>Quote from Steven Schwartz&#39;s paper:</p> <blockquote> <p>For most aspects of space plasmas, and certainly for the waves observed in the magnetosheath, fluid-based descriptions of any kind are inadequate, particularly under the \(\beta > 1\) conditions found there.

Several kinds of instabilities can be triggered: mirror mode instability and L-mode electromagnetic ion-cyclotron instability &#40;EMIC&#41;. The development of pressure anisotropy can have a significant stabilizing effect on the dynamic evolution, while a reduction of the anisotropy as expected from microscopic, anisotropy driven instability reduces this stabilization and brings the evolution closer to the isotropic case <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/95JA01401">Birn&#43;1995</a>. EMIC mode dominates when the plasma β is low while mirror mode dominates when the plasma β is high. Slow modes may also be present within the plasma depletion layer<sup id="fnref:PDL"><a href="#fndef:PDL" class=fnref >[4]</a></sup>, although they are expected to suffer strong damping. These instabilities, if exist, allow energy transfer from the plasma to the electromagnetic field and creates the waves via reducing the temperature anisotropy and creating magnetic field oscillations for the mirror instability. So in a sense the instability initiates the waves, and the waves are these oscillations once they are &quot;established&quot; in the plasma.</p> <p><table class=fndef  id="fndef:heating"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:heating">[3]</a> <td class=fndef-content >Yuxi provides me with a nice starting point to think about this. The 1st adiabatic invariant, i.e. magnetic moment \(\mu_m = \frac{1}{2}m v_\perp^2 / B\) is almost conserved if the gyromotion is not violated. Across the quasi-perpendicular shock, the strength of the magnetic field increases, so the perpendicular thermal velocities must increase to maintain the magnetic moment. Therefore the perpendicular direction is preferentially heated downstream of the shock. For example, if the B field is increased by a factor of 2, then the ion perpendicular thermal velocity should increase by a factor of \(\sqrt{2}\), and the ion perpendicular pressure should also increase by a factor of 2?

It was early recognized that this mode for being excited require a transverse pressure &#40;or temperature&#41; anisotropy.<a href="#footnote-anisotropy_source" class=footnote >[anisotropy_source]</a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19660020059/">Rudakov &amp; Sagdeyev</a> explained its physics using fluid approach in a paper written in Russian.</p> <p> This instability has generally been called mirror instability because a loss cone distribution inherently creates such an anisotropic pressure. It is actually not quite relevant in the mirror fusion machine because it has never become a high-β machine. For a complete theoretical derivation, I must read the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1692407">classical Hasegawa paper</a>.</p> <p>In 1967, Masayoshi Tajiri derived a kinetic description of the mirror mode when considering the propagation of linear &#40;i.e. small amplitude&#41; MHD waves in a collisionless plasma under homogeneous background. The key difference when compared against the CGL fluid approach is that is mirror mode is shown to be an <strong>non-oscillating</strong> mode with vanishing real part of the frequency, which means that it has zero frequency in the plasma rest frame. Under proper conditions, the non-oscillating wave causes the mirror instability in the direction nearly <strong>perpendicular</strong> to a magnetic field.</p> <p>In 1969, Akira Hasegawa extend the kinetic theory to a nonuniform medium which takes magnetic field gradient and finite-Larmor-radius effect into account. If we consider finite Larmor radius &#40;FLR&#41; effect, then the mirror mode becomes a <em>drift</em> mirror instability, which leads to the \(r^2_L \nabla^2\) term in the drift velocity. The Larmor radius is much larger for ions than for electrons, so the drift will create charge separation and electric fields. If we consider inhomogeneity, the non-propagation is also no longer true.</p> <p>Since the magnetic field in mirror modes forms extended though slightly oblique magnetic bottles, low parallel energy particles can be trapped in mirror modes and redistribute energy. Such trapped electrons excite banded whistler wave emission known under the name of lion roars and indicating that the mirror modes contain a trapped particle component while leading to the splitting of particle distributions into trapped and passing particles. The most amazing fact about mirror modes is, however, that they evolve in the practically fully collisionless regime of high temperature plasma where it is on thermodynamic reasons entirely impossible to expel any magnetic field from the plasma.<sup id="fnref:question"><a href="#fndef:question" class=fnref >[5]</a></sup> The fact that magnetic fields are indeed locally extracted makes mirror modes similar to “superconducting” structures in matter as known only at extremely low temperatures. Of course, microscopic quantum effects do not play a role in mirror modes. However, it seems that all mirror structures have typical scales of the order of the ion inertial length which implies that mirrors evolve in a regime where the transverse ion and electron motions decouple. In this case the Hall kinetics comes into play.</p> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:question"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:question">[5]</a> <td class=fndef-content >how should I interpret this sentence? Mirror modes cause some structuring of the plasma thus generating a state of lower entropy than the initial state. Moreover, the plasma is ideally conducting which implies that plasma and magnetic field are frozen and cannot be separated from each other. One therefore has to find a mechanism which distorts both the frozen-in state and leads to lower entropy without violating the second theromodynamics law, in other words, the lower entropy state has to be a state of reduced free energy. </table> <h4 id=ambiguity_about_mirror_modes ><a href="#ambiguity_about_mirror_modes" class=header-anchor >Ambiguity about mirror modes</a></h4> <p>Mirror mode oscillation is the lowest frequency <strong>perpendicular</strong> magnetic excitation in magnetized plasma. In principle mirror modes are some version of slow mode waves, i.e. the density and magnetic field fluctuations are in strict anti-phase. Fluid theory, however, does not give a correct physical picture of the mirror mode. As the lowest frequency mode it can be expected that mirror modes serve as one of the dominant energy inputs into plasma. This is however true only when the mode grows to large amplitude leaving the linear stage.<a href="https://npg.copernicus.org/articles/11/647/2004/npg-11-647-2004.pdf">Treumann&#43;, 2004</a></p> <p>At such low frequencies, on the other hand, quasilinear theory does not apply as a valid saturation mechanism. Probably the dominant processes are related to the generation of gradients in the plasma which serve as the cause of drift modes thus transferring energy to shorter wavelength propagating waves of higher nonzero frequency. This kind of theory has not yet been developed as it has not yet been understood why mirror modes in spite of their slow growth rate usually are of very large amplitudes indeed of the order of \(|B/B_0|^2\sim O(1)\).</p> <p>Quasilinear theory predicts the reduction of the initial ion pressure anisotropy towards stabilization up to a minimum required for keeping the final state. Though this seems to be quite reasonable, the validity of the theory is strongly questionable because the mirror mode is a non-oscillatory wave mode of small growth rate such that averaging over the period of the wave oscillation becomes spurious. There is plenty of time for other higher frequency instabilities to develop feeded by either the plasma anisotropy or by the plasma gradients self-consistently generated by the linear mirror mode itself in the plasma. In the first case one expects ion cyclotron instabilities to arise, in the second case short-wavelength high-frequency drift instabilities should evolve rapidly destroying the mirror mode.</p> <p>More questions arise when thinking about mirror modes.</p> <ol> <li><p>In plasma with temperature &#40;pressure&#41; anisotropy \(A = T_\perp/T_\parallel > 1\) required for mirror modes to exist, Alfvén waves remain stable and cannot be excited unless some peculiar mechanism &#40;like fast field aligned ion beams propagating across the plasma or local field-aligned electric potential drops serving as sources of Alfvén waves&#41; is at work.

This low energy zero parallel velocity component is crucial in formation of mirror modes &#40;as has been realized first by Southwood and Kivelson, 1993&#41; since it is the one which is in resonance.</p> </ol> <p><table class=fndef  id="fndef:mystery"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:mystery">[6]</a> <td class=fndef-content >This is one of the most confusing point when I thought that mirror mode was just one kind of slow mode. Slow mode in MHD propagate preferably in the parallel direction, which is the opposite of mirror mode. This strange property also indicates that in GSM coordinates of the magnetosheath, we shall look at Bz perturbation for mirror mode, especially in low latitude regions. </table> From this discussion it follows that the mere existence of mirror mode structures is a somewhat strange fact, in particular because in high temperature plasma a large number of oscillation modes like drift waves may arise which will fatally affect the evolution of mirror modes. However the existence of mirror bubbles suggests that they themselves represent a lowest frequency quasi-stationary mode that may evolve in a high temperature plasma leading to a distinct spatial structuring of the plasma both in the magnetic field as in the plasma pressure and densities. Mirror modes in their nonlinear state thus represent a state of minimum free energy in an anisotropic high temperature plasma with excess transverse temperature. Since structures of this kind have very low phase velocity \(\omega/k \approx 0\) in the plasma frame they are subject to convection along with the plasma itself. Their frequency in the spacecraft frame is given by \(\omega_{sc}\approx \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v}\) causing distinct frequency power spectra \(P(\omega_{sc})\) which map the wavelength spectrum \(P(\mathbf{k})\) of the mirror modes into the frequency domain.</p> <h4 id=properties ><a href="#properties" class=header-anchor >Properties</a></h4> <p>See a nice review in the section &quot;Summary of linear theory&quot; in <a href="https://npg.copernicus.org/articles/11/647/2004/npg-11-647-2004.pdf">Treumann&#43;, 2004</a>.</p> <p>The energy source of the mirror mode is the pressure &#40;or temperature&#41; anisotropy of the ions.

This is an energizing process, since the locally increasing field increases both the perpendicular and parallel energy of the particles. However, the perpendicular energy increases to a greater degree than the parallel energy, which makes the resulting distribution anisotropic. Similarly, by preserving the first adiabatic invariant, convection electric fields provide perpendicular energy as warm ions are transported radially inward <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/98JA01740">Summers&#43;, 1998</a>. Other processes can lead to radial transport as well, including coherent response to shocks in the solar wind, interactions with solar wind–driven ULF waves, and drift scattering by storm time Pc5 waves.</p> </ol> <p>Newly excited EMIC waves are often transverse and left-hand polarized, consistent with the direction of ion gyration in the magnetic field. After being generated, EMIC waves can be guided along the magnetic field lines and propagate from the source region to other magnetic latitudes. In the case of the equatorial source region, they propagate from the equatorial plane to higher latitudes. Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite &#40;CRRES&#41; EM field data &#40;covering only MLT &#61; 14:00 – 18:00&#41; shows that the directions of the energy propagation &#40;i.e., Poynting vector&#41; of EMIC waves are unidirectional when |MLAT| &gt; 11° but they are bidirectional in the MLAT range of &#91;-11°, 11°&#93; in the inner magnetosphere. Depending on their frequency w.r.t. the local ion gyrofrequencies such as \(f_{He^+}\), some waves are well guided along the field lines and can generally propagate to the ground. Some waves may even experience a polarization reversal where the wave frequency f is equal to the crossover frequency \(f_{co}\) &#40;???&#41; during their higher-latitude propagation and then be reflected where f equals the bi-ion hybrid frequency \(f_{bi}\) &#40;???&#41; at an even higher latitude. As a result, their polarization is crossed over from a left-hand to a right-hand or linear mode. These waves could undergo multiple equatorial crossings along magnetic flux tubes without a large radial or azimuthal drift. Because of their successive passes through the equatorial wave growth region, the waves are expected to be drastically amplified by continuing to obtain energy from the energetic protons. Nevertheless, Horne and Thorne found that, in the absence of density gradients, significant wave amplifications can only occur on the first equatorial pass because wave normal angles become large after the initial pass. Horne and Thorne concluded that wave damping by thermal heavy ions also makes it impossible for the same EMIC wave packet to bounce through its source region multiple times. But, a consensus about the wave propagation and reflection has not been reached.</p> <p><a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3dh4j07v">A dissertation on the THEMIS observation of EMIC waves in the Earth’s Magnetosphere</a></p> <p>Ion-cyclotron wave can be derived in a Hall MHD framework: it comes as one of the two solutions from the dispersion relation, the other being electron-cyclotron wave, more commonly known as whistler wave.

A bunch of studies in late 1980s and early 1990s &#40;e.g. &#91;Gary&#43;&#93;&#41; argued that the presence of \(He^{++}\) tends to increase the EMIC threshold while the mirror mode growth is less affected by the presence of \(He^{++}\) ions.

The field-line resonance describes <em>the resonant interaction between compressional fast waves and shear Alfvén waves in a non-uniform plasma</em> such as the Earth magnetosphere. The concept of this resonant mode coupling was first outlined by Tsutomu Tamao in 1961 and later discussed in his seminal paper on hydromagnetic coupling resonances &#40;Tamao, 1965&#41;. Experimental work by John Samson&#43; &#40;1971&#41; made resonant mode coupling the current paradigm of planetary magnetospheric ULF-wave research.</p> <p>We learned from ground, ionospheric, and space observations about the existence of <em>only one or at least a few</em> resonant field line vibrations &#40;i.e. eigenoscillations&#41; in the Pc5 range in the magnetosphere. As the Alfvén velocity is varying in the radial direction and as most sources of magnetospheric hydromagnetic waves are broadband sources, the resonance condition can be matched at an infinite number of geomagnetic field lines. Thus, every field line should be in resonance for a broad enough energy source. Thus the observational fact of &quot;magic&quot; frequencies requires a magnetospheric frequency selection rule. &#91;Kivelson and Southwood, 1985&#93; suggested that perturbations due to a broadband source at, e.g., the magnetopause first couple to the discrete eigenoscillations of global compressional eigenmodes. These narrow band compressional modes then couple to Alfvénic perturbations due to the field line resonance mechanism. The global modes thus select the frequency components participating in the resonant coupling. An alternative way of selection has been proposed by &#91;Fujita&#43;, 1996&#93;, who demonstrated that the K–H instability at the surface of a non-uniform magnetospheric plasma introduces dispersive properties of the unstable waves, which then gives rise to a narrower source spectrum. Thus, the field line resonance concept as outlined above is able to explain the major features of observed resonant ULF pulsations in the terrestrial magnetosphere.</p> <p>Possible mechanism</p> <ul> <li><p>MHD waveguide</p> <li><p>MHD cavity modes</p> </ul> <p> In fact, the coupling of cavity or waveguide eigenmodes to FLRs may explain how discrete spectra are produced across a range of latitudes, including at the &quot;magic&quot; frequencies. The global cavity modes <em>may be</em> responsible for the appearance of ULF signals with multiple discrete spectral peaks at the &quot;magic&quot; frequencies and spanning a range of latitudes, but it is hard to detect with satellites. &#40;This is interesting, the Archer&#43; 2019, 2022 papers handle this.&#41;</p> <p>Thinking about fast modes propagating in dayside magnetosphere trapped or guided by the field lines and boundaries within.

However, later people have found that the same can be triggered by solar wind dynamic pressure fluctuation. Simultaneous measurements are applied to show that periodic fluctuations in the solar wind dynamic pressure drives ULF pulsations in the magnetosphere. A one‐to‐one correspondence was observed between the solar wind number density oscillation frequencies and oscillation frequencies in dayside magnetic field measurements from the GOES satellite. Even magnetotail lobe oscillations have been associated with upstream dynamic pressure fluctuation. One statistical study in 2009 by Viall&#43; is trying to argue that 50&#37; of the ULF waves in the magnetosphere is driven by upstream solar wind dynamic pressure fluctuations.</p> <p>In <a href="http://www.igpp.ucla.edu/people/mkivelson/Publications/116-JA095iA03p02301.pdf">SouthwoodKivelson1990</a>, they provided a theoretical work on the FLRs and cavity mode as magnetospheric response to solar wind dynamic pressure changes.</p> <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006659717963">Glassmeier&#43;, 1999</a> presented a nice review on the FLR theory.

Dissipation due to collisions, that are Ohmic and viscous effects, is neglected as well as electron inertia. In the following we will outline Tamao’s treatment for historical reasons and to demonstrate how detailed his early study really was.</p> <p>The equation for the velocity perturbation component transverse to the ambient dipole field is given by</p> \[ \nabla^2 \Big( \mathbf{C}\times\hat{\eta} - i\frac{\omega}{\Omega_i} \Big) \times \hat{\eta} + \Big(\frac{\omega}{V_A}\Big)^2 C_\perp = 0 \] <p>where \(\omega\) is the wave frequency, \(\mathbf{C} = B\mathbf{v}_1\) where \(\mathbf{v}_1\) is the perturbation velocity, B is the intensity of the background dipole magnetic field, \(\Omega_i = eB/m_i\) is the ion gyrofrequency, \(V_A = B/\sqrt{\mu_0 \rho_0}\) is the Alfvén speed. Dipole coordinates \((\xi,\eta,\phi)\) are used with unit vectors \((\hat{\xi}, \hat{\eta}, \hat{\phi})\) pointing in the direction of common sense.</p> <p>Restricting the discussion of the above equation to the near-equatorial region, assuming a variation of \(V_A\) and \(\Omega_i\) with \(\eta\) only, and with an azimuthal dependence \(e^{im\phi}\) allows one to separate the poloidal \(S(\eta)\) and toroidal \(T(\eta)\) field variations. By introducing a new meridional variable \(\zeta = \eta^{-1/3}\) these two equations read as</p> \[\begin{aligned} \frac{d^2 S}{d\zeta^2} + 9 \zeta^6 f_0(\zeta)S = 3 im\frac{d}{d\zeta}(\zeta^{-4}T), \\ 3\zeta^4 f_m(\zeta)T = im\frac{dS}{d\zeta}, \end{aligned}\] <p>with</p> \[ f_m(\zeta) = \Big( \frac{2\pi^{1/2}r_o \omega}{B_0}\Big)^2 \zeta^{-32}\rho(\zeta) - m^2 \zeta^{-8} - k^2, \] <p>and</p> \[ f_0(\zeta) = f_m(\zeta) + m^2 \zeta^{-8}. \] <p>Here \(B_0\) and \(r_0\) are the equatorial strength of the dipole magnetic field and the equatorial distance of the field line, respectively, and k is the constant of separation &#40;\(B_1(\eta) = k*S(\eta)*T(\eta)\) ?&#41;. For an azimuthal wave number \(m = 0\), the coupling terms vanish on the right hand sides of equations of S and T. The results are two decoupled equations for the poloidal and toroidal field variations, as described earlier in Dungey&#39;s 1954 paper on ULF pulsations. For arbitrary azimuthal wave number, \(T(\zeta)\) can be eliminated from the equations with a second order differential equation resulting for \(S(\zeta)\):</p> \[ \frac{d^2 S}{d\zeta^2} + \frac{f_m}{f_0}\frac{d}{d\zeta}\Big( \frac{f_0}{f_m} \Big) \frac{dS}{d\zeta} + 9 \zeta^6 f_m S = 0. \] <p>This 1D wave equation exhibits singular points at \(f_m = 0\) and at \(f_0 = 0\). Solutions near \(f_0(\zeta_0) = 0\) may be expanded around \(\zeta_0\), and with the transformation \(x = \zeta - \zeta_0\) we obtain</p> \[ \frac{d^2 S}{dx^2} + \frac{1}{x}\frac{dS}{dx} - b^2 S = 0, \] <p>with \(b^2 = (3m/\zeta_0)^2\). The solution of the above equation exhibits a logarithmic singularity at \(x=0\). Near \(x=0\) we have \(S\approx \ln{x}\), \(dS/d\zeta\approx x^{-1}\), and \(\approx x^{-1}\). Furthermore, Tamao found that the \((\xi,\eta,\phi)\) components of the Poynting flux near the singular point approach inifinity in the order of \(\ln{x},x^{-2}\), and \(x^{-1}\), respectively.</p> <p>The importance of the above treatment of the problem of wave propagation and mode coupling in a nonuniform magnetized plasma had not been realized before <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0032-0633&#40;74&#41;90078-6">Southwood, 1974</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/JA079i007p01024">Chen and Hasegawa, 1974</a> rediscovered the field line resonance phenomenon.<sup id="fnref:Chen"><a href="#fndef:Chen" class=fnref >[7]</a></sup></p> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:Chen"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:Chen">[7]</a> <td class=fndef-content >陈瑠这个名字我在哪本等离子体的教材或者文章中看见过。 </table> <h4 id=1d_flr_theory ><a href="#1d_flr_theory" class=header-anchor >1D FLR Theory</a></h4> <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0032-0633&#40;74&#41;90078-6">Southwood, 1974</a> proposed an elucidating 1D box model for field line resonance and later extended the model for various cases &#40;e.g. <a href="http://www.igpp.ucla.edu/people/mkivelson/Publications/116-JA095iA03p02301.pdf">Southwood &amp; Kivelson, 1990</a>&#41;.

The following solutions are possible. Let us first assume the case \(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 > 0\), from which \(R^2 - k_z^2 > 0\) follows. Thus, no singularities appear. Assuming further \(k_y \approx 0\), the above equation reduces to</p> \[ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}E_y + (R^2 - k_z^2)E_y = 0. \] <p>For a linear density profile, i.e. \(R^2(x) = \alpha_0^2 + \alpha^2 x\), with the definition of the turning point \(x_T\) via \(R_T^2 = \alpha_0^2 + \alpha^2 x_T = k_z^2\), and the transformation \(s = \alpha^{2/3}(x-x_T)\)</p> \[ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial s^2}E_y + sE_y = 0. \] <p>This is an Airy or Stokes differential equation<sup id="fnref:airy"><a href="#fndef:airy" class=fnref >[10]</a></sup> with the two principal solutions displayed below. The solution \(Bi(s)\) is unphysical as it implies unlimited growth of \(E_y\) behind the turning point at \(s=0\). Thus \(E_y(s) = Ai(s)\) is the required solution. The turning point actually is the point of total reflection of the wave field. Its appearance can be understood on the following grounds. The fast mode dispersion relation is given by</p> \[ \frac{\omega^2}{k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2} = V_A^2, \] <p>where \(k_x\) is the wave number in the x-direction. If \(V_A^2\) increases with x, that is with \(s\) in the Airy function plot, \(k_x^2\) has to decrease as \(\omega, k_y\) and \(k_z\) stay constant. Eventually \(k_x^2\) may become negative, which implies an imaginary wave number \(k_x\). At this turning point the wave will be reflected.</p> <p><table class=fndef  id="fndef:airy"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:airy">[10]</a> <td class=fndef-content >a good time to go back to Y.Y&#39;s note&#33; </table> <img src="/Ganymede/assets/Airy_FLR.png" alt=""></p> <p>Considering the case \(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 < 0\), \(R^2 - k_z^2 = 0\) may occur. Assuming again a linear density profile, defining a resonance point \(x_\omega\) via \(R_\omega^2 = \alpha_0^2 + \alpha^2 x_\omega = k_z^2\), and \(s = l(x-x_\omega)\), the electric field perturbation transforms close to the resonance point \(x - x_\omega = 0\) into</p> \[ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial s^2}E_y + \frac{1}{s}\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial s} - E_y = 0, \] <p>which is a modified Bessel equation. This is equivalent to Tamao&#39;s approach. At the resonance point its solution exhibits a clear singularity, that is unlimited growth of \(E_y\). A discussion of the general solution of the electric field perturbation equation for the case \(R^2 - k_z^2 - k_y^2 < 0\) is lengthy. Schematically the solution is given in the bottom panel of the above figure. It can be seen that in front of the turning point the solution is similar to an Airy function, while behind it singular behaviour is observed at the resonance point.</p> <p>The following physical interpretation is tempting. The MHD wave propagating into the magnetosphere is a fast mode wave generated by, e.g., plasma instabilities at the magnetopause. Eventually the wave reaches the turning point where reflection occurs. If conditions are favourable, that is if a resonance point occurs, part of the fast mode wave energy can tunnel into the resonance, where coupling from the fast mode disturbance into an Alfvén mode perturbation takes place. This scenario is schematically shown in Figure 7, where the reflection or turning point is assumed to coincide with the magnetopause. The point of maximum coupling or “resonant mode coupling” is given by \(\omega - k_\parallel V_A(x)\), where \(\omega\) is the fast mode wave frequency, \(k_\parallel\) is the field-aligned component of the fast mode wave vector and \(V_A(x)\) is the local Alfvén velocity.</p> <img src="/Ganymede/assets/schematic_FLR.png" alt=""> <p>The energy that is carried into the magnetosphere across the background field by the non-guided fast mode is accumulated in the plane of resonant mode coupling &#40;i.e., the y–z plane through \(x_ω\) in the box model Figure&#41; in the form of the guided Alfvén wave. It is this localized accumulation of energy due to resonant mode coupling between a non-guided mode and a guided mode that constitutes a field line resonance. This wave energy accumulation can be described by</p> \[ \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{S} = -h, \] <p>where \(w\) is the wave energy density, \(\mathbf{S}\) is the Poynting flux, and h a dissipation term, describing energy loss due to e.g. ionospheric Joule heating. As the background parameters only vary in the radial direction, this equation reduces to</p> \[ \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = -\frac{d}{dr}S_x - h. \] <p>Integration across the width of the coupling region in a radial direction leads to the following rate equation:</p> \[ \frac{\partial W}{\partial t} = c_e S_{ng} - S_h^{off} - H, \] <p>where \(W\) is the energy per area that is being accumulated in the coupling, \(c_e\) is a coupling efficiency, \(S_{ng}\) the incoming Poynting flux of the non-guided mode, and \(S_g^{off}\) the “off-angle” component of the Poynting flux of that mode to which the non-guided mode couples. Including this term \(S_g^{off}\) allows us to consider energy losses due to coupling to not strictly guided modes. A finite off-angle component of the coupled wave mode would render the energy accumulation less efficient or may even inhibit the build-up of a resonance. Off-angle components may arise if the transverse scale of the coupled wave become small enough for finite ion gyroradius or finite electron inertia becoming important. In this case the coupled mode is a <strong>kinetic Alfvén mode</strong>. The parameter \(c_e\) denotes the coupling efficiency, that is the fraction of energy of the non-guided mode that is converted into the guided mode. Finally, H gives the dissipative losses, integrated in the x direction.</p> <p>It is now instructive to evaluate the rate Equation for the ideal MHD regime. As the Alfvén mode is a strictly guided mode its Poynting flux is directed exactly parallel to the background magnetic field. In other words, \(S_h^{off}=0\), and Equation reads</p> \[ \frac{\partial W}{\partial t} = c_e S_{fast}, \] <p>where \(S_{fast} = S_{ng}\) is the Poynting flux of the non-guided MHD mode. Thus, the energy density in the coupling region is continuously increasing as there is no outward transport of energy to balance the incoming Poynting flux of the fast mode. However, ionospheric Joule heating provides a significant dissipation mechanism with H limiting the energy density.</p> <p>Note that resonant mode coupling is only a <strong>necessary</strong> condition for field line resonances to occur. A <strong>sufficient</strong> condition is critical coupling to a strictly guided mode and absence of any dissipation.</p> <p>At the resonance a phase shift of \(180^o\) between the toroidal field components &#40;\(E_x\) in the box model, \(b_\phi\) in the dipole coordinate&#41; on both sides of the resonance is apparent. This phase shift can be understood using Maxwell&#39;s equations with the polarization current \(\mathbf{j}_\perp = \rho_0/B_0^2\cdot d\mathbf{E}/dt\), and deriving</p> \[ (R^2 - k_z^2)E_x = ik_y \Big( \frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} - ik_y E_x \Big) = k_y \omega b_z. \] <p>At the resonance \(R_^2 = k_z^2\), thus \(b_z=0\), and for the electric field polarization we have</p> \[ \frac{E_x}{E_y} = -\frac{i}{k_y E_y}\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x}. \] <p>The polarization therefore depends on \(k_y\) as well as \(\partial E_y/\partial x\). As \(k_y\) changes sign across local noon for, e.g., K-H instability generated fast mode waves at the magnetopause and \(\partial E_y/\partial x\) changes sign across the resonance point.</p> <p>Let \(\xi = (\xi_x, \xi_y, \xi_z)\) be the wave displacement vector and \(B_{1z}\) be the compressional magnetic perturbation. Linearized MHD equations take the form</p> \[\begin{aligned} \Big( \frac{\mu_0 \rho(x)}{B^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} + k_z^2 \Big) \xi_x &= -\frac{1}{B}\frac{\partial B_{1z}}{\partial x} \\ \Big( \frac{\mu_0 \rho(x)}{B^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} + k_z^2 \Big) \xi_y &= -ik_y\frac{B_{1z}}{B} \\ b_z = -ik_y B \xi_y - B\frac{\partial \xi_x}{\partial x} \end{aligned}\] <p>First assume we have uniform B field \(\mathbf{B} = B_0 \hat{z}\) but a 1D density variation \(\rho = \rho(x)\).

One basic approach to identify waves is to check the correlation of quantity perturbations.</p> <p>The phase speed of shear Alfvén wave is</p> \[ v_{pA} = \frac{\omega}{k} = v_A \cos{\theta} \] <p>where \(v_A\) is the Alfvén speed and \(\theta\) is the angle between wave vector \(\mathbf{k}\) and magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\).</p> <p>The perturbed quantities of Alfvén waves follow the relations</p> \[\begin{aligned} \frac{\delta \mathbf{v}}{v_A} &= \pm \frac{\delta \mathbf{B}}{B_0}, \\ \delta \rho &= 0, \end{aligned}\] <p>where \(\delta \mathbf{v}\), \(\delta \mathbf{B}\), and \(\delta \rho\) are perturbed plasma velocity, magnetic fields, and plasma density, respectively, and \(B_0\) is the background magnetic magnitude.</p> <p>For slow and fast waves, the phase speeds are</p> \[ v_{p\pm}^2 = \big(\frac{\omega}{k} \big) = \frac{1}{2}(V_s^2 + V_A^2) \pm \frac{1}{2}\Big[ (V_s^2 + V_A^2)^2 - 4V_s^2 V_A^2 \cos^2{\theta}\Big]^{1/2} \] <p>The &quot;&#43;&quot; is for fast waves and &quot;−&quot; for slow waves, and \(V_S\) is the sound speed.

The slopes of the curves \(\delta E∕\delta B\) correspond to the wave propagation speed in the spacecraft frame.</p> <p>Transverse and shear Alfvén wave refer to actually the same thing: the descriptions arise from \(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{V} = 0\) and \(\mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{B}_0 = 0\).</p> <p>The fast and slow magnetosonic waves are associated with non-zero perturbations in the plasma density and pressure, and also involve plasma motion parallel, as well as perpendicular, to the magnetic field. The latter observation suggests that the dispersion relations \(\omega = kV_{\pm}\) are likely to undergo significant modification in collisionless plasmas. In order to better understand the nature of the fast and slow waves, let us consider the cold-plasma limit, which is obtained by letting the sound speed \(V_S\) tend to zero. In this limit, the slow wave ceases to exist &#40;in fact, its phase velocity tends to zero&#41; whereas the dispersion relation for the fast wave reduces to</p> \[ \omega = kV_A. \] <p>This can be identified as the dispersion relation for the compressional-Alfvén wave. Thus, we can identify the fast wave as the compressional-Alfvén wave modified by a non-zero plasma pressure.</p> <p>In the limit \(V_A\gg V_S\), which is appropriate to low-β plasmas, the dispersion relation for the slow wave reduces to</p> \[ \omega \simeq k\,V_S\,\cos\theta. \] <p>This is actually the dispersion relation of a sound wave propagating along magnetic field-lines. Thus, in low-β plasmas the slow wave is a sound wave modified by the presence of the magnetic field.</p> <p>In reality, waves can be mixed together with mode conversions. Also, notice that the classical wave theory is based on spatially homogeneous plasma assumption, which is rarely the case in nature such as the magnetosphere.</p> <p>A tricky part in practice is how to get the average through smoothing. Note that a real satellite moves both in time and space. Usually people do moving-box-average to get an average state within a short period.</p> <p>A more careful analysis is called Walén test.</p> <p>However, always keep in mind that the most reliable way of identifying waves is to calculate the dispersion relation.</p> <h3 id=polarization_analysis ><a href="#polarization_analysis" class=header-anchor >Polarization analysis</a></h3> <p>Singular Value Decomposition &#40;SVD&#41;: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JA020469">Lee &amp; Angelopoulos</a></p> <p>hodogram of field components</p> <h3 id=wave_vector_direction ><a href="#wave_vector_direction" class=header-anchor >Wave vector direction</a></h3> <p>The direction of the wave vector can be estimated using MVA on the measured magnetic field.
