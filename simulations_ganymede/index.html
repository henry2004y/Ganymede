Since the real electron temperature is unknown, whichever yields a reasonable ionospheric mass density is chosen. To avoid the ion plasma density decreases below the mostly atomic background ion density \(n_0 = \rho_0∕m_i\), the loss rate is modified by</p> \[ L(\mathbf{r},t) = \begin{cases} \alpha n(\mathbf{r},t)(n(\mathbf{r},t) - n_0) & \text{for } n(\mathbf{r},t) > n_0,\\ 0 & \text{for } n(\mathbf{r},t) \le n_0. \end{cases} \] <p>When equalizing the production and loss rate to receive the plasma number density at the surface in chemical equilibrium,</p> \[ n_s = \sqrt{\frac{\nu_\text{ion}n_{n,0}}{\alpha}}. \] <p>The estimated surface density the therefore around \(n_s\approx 1500\, \text{cm}^{-3}\), which is higher than previous observation and close to another model estimation.</p> <p>In order to achieve this equilibrium, they ran the model for approximately 1.2 million iterations with a time step controlled by the Courant‐Friedrichs‐Lewy criterion which respects all physical effects.</p> <p>One thing worth noticing here is that in the final simulation result, the peak density is about 2350 &#91;\(\text{amu}/\text{cc}\)&#93;, or 75 &#91;\(\text{cc}^{-1}\)&#93;, which is 20 time smaller than the estimated value above.

This won&#39;t make much of a difference to the magnetopause location because the pressure balance is predominantly determined by the magnetic pressure and dynamic pressure.</p> <p>They do not specify the inner boundary conditions in the published paper. While they have kinetic ions in their model, only the simulated electric and magnetic fields are used in another test particle model to compute the precipitation fluxes for the energetic particles. This probably means that there are some issues with the hybrid model itself, otherwise why not use the information from the model directly?</p> <h2 id=wang_2018 ><a href="#wang_2018" class=header-anchor >Wang, 2018</a></h2> <p>10-moment equation model.</p> <h2 id=exosphere ><a href="#exosphere" class=header-anchor >Exosphere</a></h2> <p><img src="/Ganymede/assets/Exosphere_Ganymede.jpg" alt=""> Possible source and loss mechanisms for the exosphere of Ganymede.</p> <h2 id=ionosphere_model ><a href="#ionosphere_model" class=header-anchor >Ionosphere Model</a></h2> <p>This is a test particle model built in the same group as the first hybrid model by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103517307054">Carnielli&#43; 2019</a>. They have a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2020.113691">follow-up paper</a> on Constraining Ganymede&#39;s neutral and plasma properties , with the improvements of adding collisions between ion and neutral species. However, they found that this effect is only important below 200 km altitude.</p> <img src="/Ganymede/assets/O2+_density.jpg" alt=""> <p>In this model, ions are generated from the ionization of the neutral exosphere, whose 3D configuration is taken from the recent model of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.04.025">Leblanc&#43;, 2017</a>. The magnetic field is provided by the MHD model of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2009JA014375">Jia&#43;, 2009</a>.</p> <p>The dominant ion species found in the model is \(O_2^+\) near the surface. The ion energy distribution agrees better with observation than the electron number density, where the model gives more than one order of magnitude less than observation. They therefore suspect that the input exosphere is the likely cause for the discrepancy.</p> <img src="/Ganymede/assets/e_density_G2.jpg" alt=""> <p>To increase the ion production rate they multiplied by 10 the \(O_2\) distribution derived by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.04.025">Leblanc&#43;, 2017</a>. This corresponds to assuming that the dynamics of molecules is exactly the same, but the ejection rate is increased by a factor of 10. This would bring the mean column density of \(O_2\), the only “observational constraint”, to \(2.44\times10^{15}\, \text{cm}^{−2}\), which is just a factor of 2 higher than the upper limit estimated by <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/305604">Hall&#43;, 1998</a>.</p> <img src="/Ganymede/assets/e_density_G2_increasedO2.jpg" alt=""> <p>In the ionospheric model, the neutral exosphere is ionized by solar EUV radiation and Jovian magnetospheric electrons. On the one hand, the photo-ionization process is derived from the solar flux, which is known with a good level of confidence. On the other hand, the electron-impact ionization frequency, which is an order of magnitude larger than the photo-ionization frequency, is less certain and potentially too strong assumptions have been made in the ionospheric model. They played with it and used an asymmetric electron-impact ionization rate:</p> <img src="/Ganymede/assets/electron_impact_ionization_rate_distribution.jpg" alt=""> <p>where the orange region is illuminated and the pink region has a 4 times higher ionization rate. &#40;I don&#39;t fully understand the calculation in this part&#33;&#41;</p> <p>This results in better comparison against the electron number density:</p> <img src="/Ganymede/assets/e_density_G2_asymm_rate.jpg" alt=""> <h3 id=electron_impact_calculation ><a href="#electron_impact_calculation" class=header-anchor >Electron impact calculation</a></h3> <h2 id=mhd-epic_2019-2020 ><a href="#mhd-epic_2019-2020" class=header-anchor >MHD-EPIC, 2019-2020</a></h2> <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JA026643">Zhou&#43;, 2019</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JA028162">Zhou&#43;, 2020</a></p> <table><tr><th align=right >Variables<th align=right >Core Boundary &#40;\(r=0.5R_G\)&#41;<th align=right >Surface Boundary &#40;\(r=1R_G\)&#41;<th align=right >Outer Boundary &#40;upstream, downstream&#41;<th align=right >Outer Boundary &#40;sides&#41;<tr><td align=right >\(\rho\)<td align=right ><td align=right >fixed, \(550 \text{amu}/cm^3\)<td align=right >fixed<td align=right >float<tr><td align=right >\(p\)<td align=right ><td align=right >fixed, \(0.115\textnormal{nPa}\)<td align=right >fixed<td align=right >float<tr><td align=right >\(p_e\)<td align=right ><td align=right >fixed, \(0.01\textnormal{nPa}\)<td align=right >fixed<td align=right >float<tr><td align=right >\(\mathbf{V}\)<td align=right ><td align=right >\(\mathbf{V}\perp\mathbf{B}\)<td align=right >fixed<td align=right >float<tr><td align=right >\(\mathbf{B}\)<td align=right >dipole<td align=right >float<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fndef:5" class=fnref >[5]</a></sup><td align=right >fixed<td align=right >float</table> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:5"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:5">[5]</a> <td class=fndef-content >For the MHD part, the float magnetic field boundary at \(r=1\) is found to be the best choice.

The key method is the same: apply a test particle Monte Carlo model with a given EM field. The key results are similar: both models show a large-scale dichotomy in surface fluxes between the polar and the lower-latitude regions of Ganymede, with certain levels of asymmetry.</p> <p><a href="https://lasp.colorado.edu/home/mop/files/2015/08/jupiter_ch21-1.pdf">Kivelson&#43;2004</a> </p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Hongyang Zhou.
